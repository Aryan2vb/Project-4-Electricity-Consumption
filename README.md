# Project 4: Mining Electricity Consumption Data for Resource Allocation and Supply Chain Enhancement

## Problem Statement

Electricity demand is not uniform, it varies across regions, industries, and time (daily, weekly, seasonal, and yearly cycles). Efficient allocation of resources requires identifying where the demand is rising, where supply bottlenecks exist, and what areas (geographic or industrial) need immediate investment in grid infrastructure, generation, or renewable energy support. This project challenges students to analyze electricity consumption data (at household, commercial, industrial, and/or regional levels) to propose data-driven insights on where governments and utility companies should invest in infrastructure, optimize distribution, or enhance supply chains.

## Few Exploratory Questions

1.  How does electricity usage vary by region, time of day, and season?
2.  Are there recurring demand spikes that could stress the grid (e.g., during summer heatwaves or festivals)?
3.  How do residential vs. commercial vs. industrial users differ in consumption?
4.  Can you forecast electricity demand for the next 5–10 years in specific regions?
5.  Which areas are at risk of under-supply if current trends continue?
6.  Find the underlying cause for this issue and mention some realistic changes that can address these issues.
7.  Build an interactive geographical heatmap that allows users to select a region and then showcases average demand and supply for the selected region.
8.  Perform predictive and descriptive analysis using this data and any other sources you deem necessary. Mention your analysis philosophy, design and methodology alongside the findings of your analysis.
